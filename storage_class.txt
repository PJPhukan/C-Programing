WHAT IS STORAGE CLASS ?
    *A storage class define scope , default initial value and lifetime of a variable.
    *In previous lecture ,we sae that DYNAMIC MEMORY ALLOCATION  is a way in which the size of a data structure can we changed during  the runtime.
    *Which assigned to a program in a typical architecture can be broken down into four segments.
        * Code
        *Static &Global variable
        *Stack
        *Heap

STORAGE CLASSES IN C:
        * Automatic variable
        * External variable
        * Static variable
        * Register variable

    *AUTOMAITC VARIABLE:
        * Scope: Local to the function body they are defined in.
        * Default Value: Garbage value(a random value).
        * Lifetime: Till the end of the function block they are defined in.
        * A variable defined without any storage class  specification is by default an Automatic variable
        * "int a " and "auto int a" are same

    * EXTERNAL VARIABLE:
        * They are same as Global variable.
        * Scope: Global to the program they are defined in.
        * Default Value:0.
        * Lifetime: These variable are declared any funtion .They are available throughout the lifetime of the program.
        * A Global variable can be changed by any function in the program.
        * "int a" writen outside any function will tell compiler that harry is a global variablr.
        * It is recommended to minimize the use of unnecessary global variable in a program.

            *Exter keyword is used to infrom our C compiler that a given variable is declared somewhere else.
            *Using extern will not allocate space for the variable.
            Example:
            parag.c
                int main {
                    int a=90;
                    printf("%d",a);
                }
            main.c
                #include"parag.c"
                extern int a;
                int main(){
                    a=89;
                    printf("%d",a);
                }


    * STATIC VARIABLE:
        * Scope: Local to the block are defined in.
        * Default Initial Value:0
        * Lifetime: They are available throughout the lifetime of the program.
        * A static variable remains under existence for use within the function for entire program run.
        * "static int a" Written inside any function  will tel compiler thet harry is a static variable.
        * It is a recommended to minimize the use of unnecessary static variable in a program. 

    * REGISTER VARIABLE:
        * Scope :Local to the function they are declared in .
        * Default Initial Value: Garbage value
        * Lifetime: They are available till the end of the function block , in which the variable is defined.
        * Register variables requests the compiler to store the variable to store the variable in the CPU Register instead of storing  the memory to have faster access.
        * Generally this is done for the variable which are being used frequently.
