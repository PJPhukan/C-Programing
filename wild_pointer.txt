WILD POINTER IN C :->
-------------------

    * Uninitialized pointer are known as wild pointer.
    * These pointers point to some arbitrary location in memory  and may cause a program to crash or behave badly.
    * Dereferencing wild pointer can cause nasty bugs.
    * It is suggested to always initialize unused pointers to NULL.

        Example:
            In the following program ptr is a wild pointer until it is given the address of a.

                int a;
                int *ptr;  // Wild pointer
                ptr=&a;  //ptr no longer wild pointer
