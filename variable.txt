1.Local variable :

        * Scope is region of the program where a defined variable can exist and beyond which it cannot be accessed.

        * variable which are accessed inside a function or a block are called local variable.

        *They can only be accessedby the function they are declared in !

        *They are inaccessible to the function s outside the function they are declaredib !


2.Global variable:

        *These are the variable defined outside the main method.

        *Global variable are accessible throughout the entire program from any functiion .

        * If a local and Global variable has the same name ,the variable will take preference.


3.Formal argument :

        *These variable are treated as local variable with in a function.

        *These variable take precedenece over global variables


4.Static variable :

        *Static variables are variables which have a property of preserving their values even when they go out of Scope.
        *They preserve their value from the previous scope and are not initialized again .
        *Static variable remains in memory throughout the span of the program .
        * Static variables are initialized to 0 if not initialized explicitly.
        * in c Static variablescan only be initialized using constant literals.
