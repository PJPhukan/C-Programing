1.What is a structure in c :
-----------------------------------------

    * Structure are user defined data type in C.
    * Using structure allows us to combine data of types together.
    * It is used to create a complex data type which contains diverse information
    * They are very similer to arrays but structure can store data of any type .whichis practically more usefull.


2.Example storing employee information :
-----------------------------------------

    * Structure are user defined data type 
    * Suppose we want to store information of 10000 employees working at ABC Pvt.Ltd

        *Name
        *Address
        *Email
        *Employee

    * Clearly we need some user defind data type which contains only this information

3.Defining a Structure :
-----------------------------------------
    struct[structure_name]{
        //data type var 1
        //data type var 2
        //data type var 3
    }
    [structure_variables];


    4.Declearing a structure :
-----------------------------------------
        We can either declare a structure along with structure definition or separatly. 

        1st type:

            #include<stdio.h>
            struct Employee{
                int id;
                char name[20];
                float marks;
            };
            struct Employee e1,e2,e3;
            int main(){
                struct Employee tt;
                return 0;
            }
        
        2nd type:

            #include<stdio.h>
            struct Employee{
                int id;
                char name[20];
                float marks;
            }e1,e2,e3;
            int main(){
                struct Employee tt;
                return 0;
            }


5.Initializing a structure: :
-----------------------------------------
    We can Initialize a structure either along with structure defination or separatly .

        
       1st type :
        
        #include<stdio.h>
            struct Employee{
                int id;
                char name[20];
                float marks;
            };
            
            int main(){
                struct Employee tt;
                tt.id=12;
                tt.marks=3.14;
                tt.name='p';
                return 0;
            }

        2nd type: 

            #include<stdio.h>
            struct Employee{
                int id;
                char name[20];
                float marks;
            };
          
            int main(){
                struct Employee tt={12,p,3.14};
                return 0;
            }


    6.Accenssing structure member :
    ---------------------------------

        * array element are sccessed using the subscript variable.
        * In a similer fashion ,structure members are sccessed using [.] operator.
        * (.) is called as "structure member operator".
        * To access the member of the structure ,we use this operator in between "Structure name"&"Member name".
