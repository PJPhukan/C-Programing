What is union?
---------------------------------------

    * Union is a user defined data type (very similer to structure)
    * The difference between structure and unions lies in the fact that in structure,each member has its own strorage location,whereas members of a union uses a single shared memory location .
    *This single shared memory location is equal to size of its largest data member.

Declearing and Accessing union members:
---------------------------------------

    *Like structure ,we access any member by using the member access operator (.) in unions.
    *We use keyword union to define a union .
    *Syntax is very similer to that of structure 

            union structure{
                int roll ;
                char name[40];
                float marks; 
            }u1;
            u1.roil =1;
            strcpy(u1.name,"Parag jyoti phukan");
            u1.marks =75.5;



We can use unions to introduce better memory management in our C program
