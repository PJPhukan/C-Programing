WHAT IS VOID POINTER:

    *  A void pointer is a pointer that has no data type associated with it.
    *  A void  pointer can be easily typecasted to any pointer type
    *  In simple languge it is a general purpose pointer variable.

    example:

        int x=10;
        char s='w';
        char y='p';
        void *p=&x; // void pointer stores address of int 'x'
        p=&y; //void pointer now holds address of char 's'
        void *q=&y; // void pointer stores address of char  'y'


  USE OF VOID POINTERS

    * In dynamic memory allocation, malloc() and calloc() return (void*) type pointer
    * This allows thse dynamic memory function to be used to allocate memory od any data typw .This is because these pointers can be typecasted to any ponter type .

-> It is not possible  to dereference void pointer.
-> Pointer arithmetic is not allowd in C standards with void ponters .
-> Hence it is not recommended to use pointer arithmetic with void pointers.
